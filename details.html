          A spy known only as Twilight needs a family as part of his undercover
          mission, so he quickly marries a city hall worker and adopts a child
          and dog. Unknown to him, his family has secrets of their own: his wife
          Yor is an undercover assassin, his daughter Anya is a runaway psychic
          who can read minds, and his dog was from a laboratory that gave him
          the power to tell the future. All these four subjects must bond
          together as a family to manage their own affairs and be together as
          best as they can.
